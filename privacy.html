                    <h2>6. California Privacy Rights (CalOPPA)</h2>
                    <p>California's Online Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) requires commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law requires any person or company that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy stating exactly what information is being collected and with whom it is being shared.</p>
                    
                    <p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Request disclosure of what personal information we collect, use, disclose, or sell</li>

                        <li>Not be discriminated against for exercising these rights</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Please note that we do not sell personal information in the traditional sense. However, using or sharing certain information may be considered a "sale" under the broad definitions in the CCPA.</p>

                    <h2>8. Analytics Providers</h2>
                    <p>We may use third-party Service Providers to monitor and analyze the use of our website:</p>
                    <ul>
